## Fun projects:

🎮 FPS Game Project

One of the most fun and rewarding projects I’ve worked on was building a first-person shooter game using the Godot engine. While it started as a passion project, it ended up teaching me a lot about software design and game architecture.

Key takeaways:

- Event-driven programming and state machines
- Vector math, raycasting, and real-time collision detection
- Performance optimization and object pooling
- Designing a responsive HUD and intuitive game loop
- Debugging and maintaining a large codebase over time

This project helped me grow as a software engineer. You can check it out [here](https://saman-explores.itch.io/zombie-siege). I have released a version for both mac and windows. I made the game open source, and you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/Mohammadreza-Beygifard/zombie-zone)
